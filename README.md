## DAN Implementation for CS769 Natural Language Processing

The two Word embeddings I use here are:

Fasttext: https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-wiki/wiki.en.zip
Glove: https://huggingface.co/stanfordnlp/glove/resolve/main/glove.6B.zip

Running the run_exp.sh script downloads both these embeddings into two folders for each respectively (fasttext and glove).

The installation process for these two can also be referred in setup.py
